# Titanic-Survival-prediction-Through-ML

â€¢	Used libraries such as Numpy , pandas, Matplotlib , done various transformation and feature selection ,Support Vector Machines learn linear classifiers from labelled training data to predict labels test data. Hence lead to much higher classification accuracies to give us even better classification accuracies
